  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a decorated captain in The Red Army during World War 2.
    However afterwards, rather than being celebrated for his service he was imprisoned in a gulag.
    He later wrote The Gulag Archipelago describing the absolutely <em>terrible</em> conditions
    suffered by himself and millions of others. 
    Solzhenitsyn is at the very least just as important 
    as the other two authors on this list if not more.
    The value of his work on the Soviet Union was immense. 
    The value of his work on informing the wider world of some of the horrors of the USSR is immeasurable.
